## About 
Travelcase derivative that runs commands rather than changing gearset or appearance.

## Features
- Set a per-character command for:
	- After changing territories (Teleport, Return, walking outside, et cetera)
	- Changing Classes/Jobs
- Roleplay Only Mode (Prevents the command from executing if you are not in the "RP" Online Status)
- RNG Mode (Executes the command randomly based on a given range)
